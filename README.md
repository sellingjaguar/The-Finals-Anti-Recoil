# The-Finals-Anti-Recoil
AHK script to compensate recoil for The Finals game with a simple GUI that can be controlled using the arrow keys, don't know if it is detected or not since I don't really use it
## How to use
Change the *sensitivity* and *window_name* values to be your game sensitivity and window name for your game (in my case I was using GeForce NOW to play) on the "main.ahk" file and play the game on borderless mode, the use the arrow keys to select your current weapon
